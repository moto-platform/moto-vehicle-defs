# vehicle-defs

Single source of truth for signals in [vehicle-platform](https://github.com/vehicle-platform): CAN message maps (DBC), the VSS overlay, UDS/DID definitions, and the code generated from them. Every other platform repo consumes this one as the `external/vehicle-defs` submodule pinned to a tag; none defines its own signals. Platform documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md).

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `uds/vehicle_cl250.yaml` | Honda CL250 ECU DIDs polled over UDS (addressing, formulas, poll rates and `high`/`normal` poll priority, timing; verified, D-019, D-043) |
| `dbc/platform.dbc` | Platform CAN bus between our nodes (ID plan, E2E attributes) |
| `dbc/cl250.dbc` | CL250 passive broadcast frames (skeleton, Q-001) |
| `vss/overlay.vspec` | COVESA VSS 6.0 overlay + `dbc2vss` mappings for kuksa-can-provider |
| `uds/dids.yaml` | UDS servers of our platform nodes: addressing, timing, services, DIDs, DTCs (RT_CORE so far, D-040) |
| `uds/iso14229.yaml` | Generic ISO 14229-1 codes, generated as `uds_iso14229.h` (D-040) |
| `ble/ble_schema.json` | BLE packet schema of vehicle-connectivity-node: telemetry versions 2/3/4, IMU block, GATT UUIDs; consumed by conn, vehicle-mobile and vehicle-server through generated code (D-061, [`ble/README.md`](ble/README.md)) |
| `limits/platform_limits.yaml` | Layer 1 thresholds `k_yellow`/`k_red` (D-041), µ/mass fallback values, rt-core's speed-age rules, and a per-node `scope` (provisional, D-029, D-048) |
| `vehicle/cl250_constants.yaml` | CL250 engine, drivetrain, tyre and fuel constants for the derived signals, each with status and source (D-070) |
| `derived/cl250_derived.yaml` | Derived signal definitions (class A/B/C/D, inputs, rate, staleness, range, ride-summary DIDs) and their non-DID sensor inputs; formulas stay in rt-core and the Python reference (D-070) |
| `tools/codegen/` | Generator and checks (Python, uv) |
| `gen/` | Generated output, committed — never edit by hand |

## Generated output

- `gen/c/<node>/` for `rt_core`, `safety`, `io`, `conn`, `hil_sim`: `platform.{h,c}` (cantools pack/unpack of only the node's messages), `vehicle_e2e.{h,c}` + `platform_e2e.{h,c}` (E2E, [`docs/e2e-profile.md`](docs/e2e-profile.md)), for rt_core/safety/hil_sim `platform_limits.h` (only the sections in the node's `scope`: safety gets no speed rules), and for vehicle-bus nodes `vehicle_cl250.{h,c}` (DID table with poll priority, response parser, D-020 request/frame allow-list that every vehicle-bus transmission must pass). C99, no heap. A firmware includes only its own node directory.
- `gen/c/rt_core/vehicle_cl250_constants.h` and `vehicle_cl250_derived.{h,c}`: the vehicle constants and the metadata table of the class-A/B derived signals (inputs, period, staleness, range, ride-summary DID, `rt_core_ready`), rt-core only (D-070).
- `gen/c/conn/ble_schema.h`: BLE packet layout as offset/size macros (header-only, no packed structs; conn static-asserts its structs against it).
- `gen/python/vehicle_defs/`: IDs, cycle times, DataIDs, CL250 constants, E2E reference, `ble.py` (BLE `SCHEMA` and constants for vehicle-server), `vehicle_constants.py` and `vehicle_derived.py` (every derived class with its readiness, for vehicle-server's reference, D-070).
- `gen/dart/vehicle_defs/`: Dart package (`lib/ble_schema.dart`) with the BLE layout constants for vehicle-mobile.
- `gen/vss/vss_dbc.json`: VSS JSON with `dbc2vss` for Kuksa / kuksa-can-provider.

## Commands

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a C compiler (for the C tests).

```bash
make check   # strict DBC parse + consistency checks + ruff + pytest
make gen     # regenerate gen/ (downloads the pinned COVESA VSS release once)
make drift   # regenerate and fail if gen/ changed (CI)
make misra   # cppcheck style + MISRA C:2012 on gen/c (CI, blocking); deviations in misra/README.md
```

Changing a signal: follow the `/signal-change` skill, add a `CHANGELOG.md` line, `make gen`, commit. Tags are cut deliberately; consumers bump their submodule deliberately.
