# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server: Architecture, Scenarios & AI Agent Capabilities

> **Idea notes, not decisions** (drafted with Gemini, 2026-10-05; moved here from the workspace root on 2026-10-07). Nothing here overrides `DECISIONS.md` or moto-mcp's read-only scope. Not yet reviewed against invariant 7 (the LLM never does its own math, raw GPS never goes to the cloud) and D-060 (no position leaves conn).

**Document:** `moto-platform/MCP_SCENARIOS_AND_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`  
**Target Repository:** `moto-mcp` (Exposed to Claude, GPT, and Local LLMs)  
**Standard Compliance:** Anthropic Model Context Protocol (MCP) v1.0, COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS v4.0), ISO 14229 (UDS), ISO 26262 ASIL-D Safe Read-Only Boundary.

---

## 1. Executive Summary & Architectural Philosophy

The `moto-mcp` service transforms the motorcycle from an opaque mechanical asset into an **Intelligent Conversational Agent**. By exposing high-cadence vehicle telemetry, UDS diagnostics, and edge anomaly states through the open **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, large language models (LLMs) can reason across live physics, historical baselines, and maintenance manuals.

### Safety & Isolation Boundary (The 4 Inviolable Rules)
1. **Strict Read-Only Enforcement (D-020):** `moto-mcp` exposes zero actuation or write tools. An LLM can never manipulate throttle, braking, fuel, or ignition.
2. **Pre-Computed Statistics (No LLM Math Hallucinations):** Tools never return raw 100,000-point time-series. Python/PyArrow pre-computes mean, standard deviation, percentiles, and anomaly scores, delivering pre-digested domain summaries.
3. **Location Privacy (Semantic Geofencing):** Raw GPS coordinates are masked into high-level semantic tags (`"Mountain Pass"`, `"Urban Congestion"`, `"15 km from Garage"`).
4. **VSS Abstraction (Vehicle-Agnostic):** Internal tool mappings utilize standard COVESA VSS signal paths (`Vehicle.Powertrain.CombustionEngine.Speed`) rather than OEM-specific CAN IDs, ensuring 100% portability to any car, van, or motorcycle.

## 3. Deep-Dive Operational Scenarios

### Domain 1: Conversational Pocket Mechanic & Live Diagnostics

#### Scenario 1.1: Spontaneous Engine Misfire & Vacuum Leak Triage
* **Context:** While riding on a highway, the rider feels a slight hesitation under acceleration. The yellow "Check Engine" indicator illuminates.
* **Rider Voice Query:** *"Engine feels sluggish and the check engine light just came on. What is happening?"*
* **Agent Tool Execution:**
  ```json
  // Call 1: Fetch active trouble codes
  run_diagnostic_triage({ "dtc_code": "P0171" })
  // Call 2: Inspect real-time vacuum and intake parameters
  get_live_telemetry_snapshot({ "attributes": ["MAP_kPa", "ENGINE_SPEED_rpm", "THROTTLE_pos", "IAT_celsius"] })
  ```
* **Tool Response Payload:**
  ```json
  {
    "dtc": "P0171 - System Too Lean (Bank 1)",
    "telemetry_anomaly": {
      "MAP_actual_kPa": 48.2,
      "MAP_expected_baseline_kPa": 34.0,
      "discrepancy_percent": "+41.7%",
      "throttle_position_pct": 14.2,
      "engine_speed_rpm": 3850
    },
    "root_cause_probability": [
      { "cause": "Intake manifold rubber boot air leak / loose clamp", "confidence": 0.88 },
      { "cause": "Clogged fuel injector nozzle", "confidence": 0.09 },
      { "cause": "Failing oxygen sensor", "confidence": 0.03 }
    ],
    "safe_to_continue": true,
    "max_recommended_speed_kmh": 80
  }
  ```
* **LLM Audio Synthesis to Helmet:**
  > *"Diagnostic code P-0-1-7-1 is active: your fuel mixture is running lean. Manifold vacuum is reading 48 kPa instead of the normal 34 kPa at this throttle opening. This strongly indicates an intake air leak around the throttle-body rubber boot. It is safe to ride home, but avoid hard acceleration to prevent exhaust valve overheating."*

---

#### Scenario 1.2: Acoustic Sound Analysis & Cold Knocking Diagnostic
* **Context:** After starting the motorcycle on a cold winter morning, the rider hears an unfamiliar metallic ticking sound from the cylinder head.
* **Rider Voice Query:** *"The engine is making a ticking noise on idle. Should I be worried?"*
* **Agent Tool Execution:**
  ```json
  get_live_telemetry_snapshot({ "attributes": ["COOLANT_TEMP_celsius", "ENGINE_SPEED_rpm", "BATTERY_VOLT", "IMU_CHASSIS_FFT_PEAKS"] })
  ```
* **Tool Response Payload:**
  ```json
  {
    "coolant_temp_celsius": 14.0,
    "oil_viscosity_state": "High Viscosity / Cold Start",
    "primary_vibration_peak_hz": 11.25,
    "valve_train_harmonic_match": true,
    "harmonic_damping_rate": "Active thermal normalization observed",
    "conclusion": "Hydraulic / valve clearance lash prior to thermal expansion"
  }
  ```
* **LLM Audio Synthesis:**
  > *"Coolant temperature is currently 14°C. The vibration frequency matches normal valve lash prior to thermal expansion. As the engine reaches 60°C over the next 3 minutes, oil viscosity will thin and the ticking will subside. No mechanical fault detected."*

### Domain 2: Pre-Ride Autonomous Flight Briefing

#### Scenario 2.1: Pre-Departure Health, Tire Pressure & Cold-Road Grip Audit
* **Context:** The rider turns on the ignition key at 07:30 AM before a 180 km weekend ride.

* **Agent Tool Execution:**
  ```json
  get_pre_ride_briefing({ "planned_distance_km": 180.0 })
  ```
* **Tool Response Payload:**
  ```json

    },
    "ambient": { "temperature_c": 6.8, "road_surface_risk": "Cold asphalt / Reduced friction coefficient (mu ~ 0.55)" },
    "clutch_brake_status": "Nominal",
    "pothole_alerts_on_route": 3
  }
  ```
* **LLM Audio Synthesis to Helmet:**
  > *"Good morning Alihan. Pre-ride check complete: Battery voltage is healthy at 12.6V. Notice: your front tire is at 28.5 PSI—3.5 PSI below recommendation. Top it up at the first station. Ambient temperature is 7°C; expect reduced asphalt grip for the first 15 kilometers. Safe ride!"*

### Domain 3: Track Day & AR Performance Coaching

#### Scenario 3.1: Post-Session Cornering Telemetry & Apex Analysis
* **Context:** Rider completes a 20-minute track session and reviews lap performance on their smartphone app.
* **Rider Voice Query:** *"Analyze my cornering in Turn 4 and tell me why my lap time was 0.8 seconds slower."*
* **Agent Tool Execution:**
  ```json

  }
  ```
* **LLM Interactive Feedback:**
  > *"In Turn 4, you initiated turn-in approximately 2.2 meters too early. This forced a tighter line mid-corner where you leaned to 41.8°, consuming 89% of your friction circle. Because the bike was on its side for too long, you could not roll on throttle until late on the exit rumble strip. Delay your turn-in point by two bike lengths to carry 5 km/h more corner-exit speed."*

#### Scenario 3.2: Automated Viral Highlight Reel Generation
* **Context:** Rider arrives at a coffee stop after carving canyon roads and wants to post on social media.

## 4. Implementation Blueprint: FastMCP Python Architecture

The `moto-mcp` service is built on the official **Anthropic FastMCP Python SDK**, exposing asynchronous decorators backed by VSS telemetry adapters:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

mcp = FastMCP("Moto-Platform Vehicle Intelligence Core")

class TelemetrySnapshot(BaseModel):
    engine_speed_rpm: float = Field(description="Engine rotational velocity")
    vehicle_speed_kmh: float = Field(description="True wheel speed from ABS sensor")
    manifold_pressure_kpa: float = Field(description="Intake vacuum pressure")
    coolant_temp_celsius: float = Field(description="Engine thermal state")
    lean_angle_deg: float = Field(description="EKF roll angle from real-time core")

@mcp.tool()
async def get_live_telemetry_snapshot(attributes: list[str]) -> TelemetrySnapshot:
    """Fetch instantaneous vehicle operating parameters via COVESA VSS broker."""
    # Queries the local Kuksa Databroker / PyArrow memory buffer
    ...

@mcp.tool()
async def run_diagnostic_triage(dtc_code: str | None = None) -> dict:
    """Perform expert automotive root-cause failure triage combining UDS DIDs and anomalies."""
    ...

@mcp.tool()
async def get_pre_ride_briefing(planned_distance_km: float) -> dict:
    """Execute automated pre-ride airworthiness inspection for tire, battery, and road grip."""
    ...
```
