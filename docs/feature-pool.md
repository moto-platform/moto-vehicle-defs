# Feature Pool, Hardware Architecture, and Open Source Reference

> Translated from the Turkish original (`tr/ozellik-havuzu.md`). Where this document conflicts with `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `DECISIONS.md`, those take precedence.

**Project:** Motorcycle embedded diagnostics, telemetry, and driver assistance platform
**Purpose:** Long-term development pool (candidate items + prioritization), hardware architecture analysis, and open source/hardware reference — in a single file
**Version:** 2.0 — September 2026

**Contents:** Sections 1-13 function/technology categories · 14 highlights · 15 out of pool · 16 prioritization framework · 17 hardware architecture analysis · 18 open source ecosystem and hardware costs

## How To Use

This document is not a commitment list — it is a **candidate pool**. For each item:

- **Effort:** rough hour estimate (prioritization input)
- **Dependency:** which item needs to be finished first
- **Value:** K = career/interview value, T = thesis/academic value, U = usage value
- **Open source:** the relevant project or standard

Prioritization suggestion: high value + low effort + few dependencies goes first.

## 14. Top Ten Highlights

Since the pool is large, I am also flagging the ten items with the highest value/effort ratio:

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| **A2 — COVESA VSS** | Low effort, high industry visibility, standardizes the foundation of the architecture |
| **D2 — MDF4 logging format** | Makes your data compatible with industry tools, low effort |
| **D7 — Foxglove** | Professional visualization, nearly free |
| **H10 — Renode** | Hardware-free CI testing, lesser-known but impressive |
| **C6 — Uptane** | The standard for OTA security, a natural continuation if building a bootloader |
| **S6 — MISRA C + static analysis** | Low effort, substantiates the "industry standard" claim |
| **H8/H9 — Unit test + coverage** | Proof of software engineering rigor |
| **F6 — Battery health indicator** | Small effort, real diagnostic technique, testable on HIL |
| **A7 — Eclipse Kuksa** | The open source reference for SDV architecture |
| **F18 — XCP + A2L** | The language of the calibration world, distinctive |
| **R2/R3 — Delta time + segment** | The heart of race telemetry, achievable with existing hardware, measurable output |

---

## 15. Deliberately Out Of Pool

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| ECU flash writing / stage mapping | Legal (off-registration modification), warranty, safety concerns; gain of only 3-5% |
| Piggyback / fuel map intervention | Risk of engine damage without wideband lambda and EGT |
| Cutting the engine while running (fuel/ignition) | Riding safety — only the starter circuit is to be intervened on |
| Applying voltage to the handlebar/frame | Harm to third parties, legal liability, ineffective |
| Autonomous driving stack (Autoware/Apollo) | Orders of magnitude beyond this platform's scale |
| Real load dump test (ISO 7637-2 pulse 5) | Requires special equipment, destroys the DUT |

---

## 16. Suggested Framework for Prioritization

I recommend sorting items into four buckets:

**Bucket 1 — Backbone.** The infrastructure everything else rests on. Without these, nothing else can be done: P1, P2, A1, D1, F2, H1, H2.

**Bucket 2 — Thesis deliverable.** The cross-section to be shown to the committee. Backbone + a few visible functions + process documentation.

**Bucket 3 — Career showcase.** What will be discussed in interviews. Items with clear industry relevance such as P3, B1, C6, F18, H7, A2, S6.

**Bucket 4 — Long-term.** Computer vision, Linux unit, V2X, autonomous functions. Sequential, without a time constraint.

Every new idea goes into the pool, not into a bucket. For something to enter a bucket, something else must come out — this rule is the only thing that keeps the pool functional.

---

## 17. Hardware Architecture Analysis and Standardization

The current system is single-node (ESP32-S3 + OBD2/CAN + Nextion). As the platform grows, this structure becomes limiting. The problem is not the ESP32-S3, but piling every task onto a single chip. Standard automotive architecture is distributed: each node handles one job, and they communicate over CAN.

### 17.1 Three-Stage Evolution

**Stage 1 — rationalizing the current structure (recommended for the thesis).**
The ESP32-S3 remains the main node, but the separation of duties becomes clear (fusion/function/logging layers). The HIL simulator is a separate chip. Hardware stays the same, only the software architecture changes (layered structure).

**Stage 2 — standard automotive MCU (extended scope).**
Keep the main unit on the ESP32-S3 (Wi-Fi/BLE is valuable), add a second node using STM32. Deterministic work (CAN timing, safety-critical loop, control) moves to the STM32. Adds an "STM32 + automotive MCU" line to the CV.

**Stage 3 — domain controller (Phase 2).**
A real-time domain (STM32/S32K) + a high-level domain (Raspi/Linux), bridged by SOME/IP. This is the modern SDV architecture itself.

### 17.2 Automotive MCU Families

| Chip family | Position | Note |
|---|---|---|
| STM32 F/G/H | General embedded | The most common learning path |
| STM32H7 | High performance + DSP | ML + control together |
| NXP S32K | AUTOSAR compliant, ASIL-B/D | Widespread in industry, ideal for Phase 2 |
| Infineon AURIX (TriCore) | Safety-critical ECU | Expensive, difficult to learn |
| Renesas RH850 | Automotive ECU | Common among Japanese OEMs |

### 17.3 Intermediate Module Standardization

| Area | Current | Standard approach |
|---|---|---|
| CAN transceiver | Generic module | TJA1051/TJA1441 (automotive), SN65HVD230 (3.3V) |
| Power regulation | Buck module | Automotive-grade DC-DC (load-dump rated) |
| Connector | Various | Deutsch DT series (waterproof, automotive standard) |
| Protection | Scattered | TVS + reverse polarity + PTC standard input stage |
| Timing | MCU internal | External RTC or GPS-disciplined clock |
| Storage | microSD | Industrial SD or eMMC |

**Deutsch DT connector** in particular: cheap (a few hundred TL) but takes the system from a "prototype" to "field hardware" look. Makes a difference with the committee and in interviews.

### 17.4 Recommendation

Stay at Stage 1 for the thesis. Take Stage 2 (STM32 second node) into the extended scope. Leave Stage 3 for Phase 2. Do not move the main unit off the ESP32-S3 — there's no good reason to lose Wi-Fi/BLE.

---

## 18. Open Source Ecosystem and Hardware Costs

> **Legal and ethical framework:** The security/reverse-engineering tools below are intended for learning and defensive use **on your own vehicle, on your own network**. Unauthorized interference with someone else's vehicle or network is both illegal and destroys the project's legitimacy. These tools are valuable in the thesis in the context of "I applied attack scenarios to my own system and developed defenses" — not as attack tools, but as security verification tools.

### 18.1 CAN / Automotive Network Tools (General)

| Project | What it does | License | Note |
|---|---|---|---|

### 18.2 Security Research and Reverse Engineering Tools

This section addresses your "hacking side" interest. Automotive security research is a serious and growing field; these tools were developed for academic and defensive purposes.

| Project | What it does | Origin / community | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CaringCaribou** | "nmap for vehicles" — CAN discovery, UDS scanning, fuzzing | Sweden (HEAVENS project) | The best-known open tool for automotive penetration testing |
| **CANToolz** | CAN analysis, MITM, fuzzing framework | **Russian security community** (Alexey Sintsov) | Modular, building attack scenarios |
| **c0f** | CAN fingerprinting | Security community | Identifying ECUs from traffic |
| **Metasploit HWBridge** | CAN attack modules via a hardware bridge | Rapid7 | CAN plugin for a penetration testing framework |
| **UDS fuzzers** | Abnormal input to UDS services | Various | Testing the robustness of your own UDS server |
| **gallia** | Automotive diagnostics fuzzing/scanning framework | Germany (Fraunhofer) | UDS/DoIP focused, modern |
| **scapy-automotive** | Scapy's CAN/ISO-TP/UDS/DoIP layer | France/community | Packet generation and analysis, very powerful |
| **OpenGarages / UDSim** | ECU simulator, learning environment | OpenGarages | The "Car Hacker's Handbook" ecosystem |

**On the Russian/former-Soviet scene:** This region has a strong tradition of reverse engineering and low-level systems programming — CANToolz is the most visible open source example of it. There is also extensive forum and community knowledge on immobilizer/key system and ECU read-write (chiptuning) and alarm system reverse engineering (drive2, various RU-language forums). Some of this knowledge sits in a gray area (it can intertwine with vehicle theft), so when selecting sources stay on the defense/research side — avoid content that drifts toward chiptuning and vehicle-theft techniques. The academic and CTF (capture-the-flag) side is clean and instructive.

**How to use this legitimately:** Scan your own motorcycle's CAN bus with CaringCaribou or gallia → learn which services are open and which IDs exist → use this information both to derive your signal map (the P items) and to test the robustness of your own UDS server/client through fuzzing (C4, C8 in the pool). In the thesis, this becomes the "I performed an attack surface analysis on my own system" section.

**Note on Speeduino/rusEFI:** These are open source ECU projects. NOT for installing on your own CL250 (out of pool — legal/warranty concerns). But worth reading to learn how engine control works, as a reference when building the HIL plant model, and to be able to say "I understand the ECU side too."

**RaceCapture (AutosportLabs):** Open source race telemetry hardware and software. A direct inspiration for the R-series (race telemetry) — see how delta time, lap analysis, and dashboards are done.

### 18.10 Note on Prioritization

Most of the open source tools in this document are **free** and require no hardware — meaning the marginal cost of the pool's software items is often zero. The real cost is in hardware, and that scales in stages. Almost all of the "top ten highlights" in Section 14 (feature pool) can be done with the free open source tools in this document: VSS, MDF4, Foxglove, Renode, MISRA tools, unit testing — none of these require additional hardware.

So when prioritizing in the next step, set the rule as follows: **sweep the zero-hardware, high-value items first** (these come with open source), and buy hardware-requiring items piece by piece only when you actually reach that function.
